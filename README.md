3 wrong choices, "dings", then death, var dings = 0, if dings===3 {deathFunction}
viewport 1140x480, 1140-640=500 (side panels?)

You command an expedition in which you have a number of people, food, money, oxen (to carry things) and firepower.

You have to reach 1000 km to your destination.

Food is consumed as you go.

You can only carry a certain amount of weight (depending on how many people and oxen you have).

If you run out of crew members or food, itâ€™s game over.

As you travel, there will be random events and sometimes you have to make decisions.

If you find shops, you can buy things.

If you are under attack, you can choose to fight or flee.
